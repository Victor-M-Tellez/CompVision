I)Image acquisition â€“ 
	I.A] A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors 
		IA.1) light-sensitive cameras: Raspberry pi
		IA.2) light-sensitive cameras: usb port camera
		 
	I.B] Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data can be:
		IC.1) an ordinary 2D image
		IC.2) a 3D volume
		IC.3) an image sequence

	I.C] The pixel values:
		IC.1) typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands 
			IC1.i) gray images 
			IC1.ii) color images
		IC.2) can also be related to various physical measures 
			IC2.i) depth, 
			IC2.ii) absorption or reflectance of: 
				IC2ii.a) sonic 
				IC2ii.b) or electromagnetic waves
				IC2ii.c) or nuclear magnetic resonance
