	II.A] Image Enhancing:
		Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, 
		it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples:
        		IIA.1] Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.
			    *Image Histogram::= The Image histogram is a plot of the number of pixels for each tonal value in an image. 
						   The Image histogram shows us the tonal distribution of an image

				IIA1.i] Histogram Equalization: allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast.
					*utilizes an image histogram in order to analyze the image and make proper changes
					*This method usually increases the global contrast of an image. 
						Specially when the usable data of the image is represented by close contrast values. 
					*Through this adjustment, the intensities can be better distributed on the histogram.  
 
	        	IIA.2] Image denoising AKA Image filtering: Methods for eliminating Signal Noise. Types of noise & their filter:
				   *definition* linear filters: use the same pattern of weigths for every window; 
							> implemented using the weighted sum of the pixels in successive windows. 
							> Spatially invarient and can be implemented using a convolution mask
				   *definition* linear smoothing filters: remove high frequency components and get rid of sharp details in an image
							> this filter has vertical and horizontal symmetry and typically one main lobe 
							> example the gaussian filter
								    
				   *definition* nonlinear filters:any filter that is not a weighted some of the pixels. 
							> Can adjust its weights so that more smoothing is done in a relatively uniform area of 
							   the image and little smoothing is done acroos sharp changes in the image.
				   *definition* spatially invarient: the same calculation is performed regardless of the position on the image
 				IIA2.i] Mean filter::=the value at each pixel is replaced by the average of all the values in the local neighborhood
							> Can be implemented as a convolution operation; 
				IIA2.ii] Median filter::= Spatially invarient, nonlinear filter. 
							> pixel[i,j] = Median value of the set containing all the pixel values in pixel[i,j] neighborhood
				IIA2.iii] Gaussian filter::= 
							> Has rotational Symmetry so the amount of smoothing performed will be the same in all directions
							> This filter will not bias subsequent edge detection in any particular direction.
							> This filter replaces each pixel with a weighted average of the neighboring pixels; Such that
							     the weight given to a neighbor decreases monotonically with distance from the center pixel
							> Acts as a low pas filter because the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is a Gaussian
							> Gaussian Functions are separable: 2D Gaussian convolution can be performed by convolving the
							     image with a 1D Gaussian, and then convolving the result with the same 1D Gaussian filter
							     used earlier, but this time the filter is orthogonal to how it was the first time
							> As the width of the Gaussian in the Spatial domain is increased, the amount of smoothing that
							     the Gaussian performs increases; But in the Frequency domain the Gaussian becomes narrower
							     and passes less High Frequency noise and texture
				IIA2.iv] salt and pepper noise::= 
					    *Some pixels in the image have been randomly assigned a color or intensity value. 
					    *the value of a noisy pixel has no relation to the color of surrounding pixels. 
					    *On Average this type of noise will only affect a small number of image pixels. 
					    *Use Median filter to remove this noise
				IIA2.v] Gaussian noise::= 
					    *contains variations in intensity that are drawn from a gaussian or normal distribution (sensor noise)
					    *Use a Linear filter to remove this noise, the gaussian filter
					    
				IIA2.vi] Impulse noise::= 
					    *Contains only random occurences of white intensity values
					    *Use Median filter to remove this noise
        		IIA.3] Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.
